This is a crude version of Pong using the built-in Godot font.
Left Player Keys: w for up, s for down
Right Player Keys: up arrow for up, down arrow for down

Important:
	You need to use Box2D for your physics engine. The default Godot physics
	engine will cause the ball to grab the paddle on collision with the top
	or bottom side and drag or teleport it.
